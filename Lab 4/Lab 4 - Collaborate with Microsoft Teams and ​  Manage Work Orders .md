+++Regular maintenance is essential to keep your air conditioner
running efficiently and prolong its lifespan. One of the most
important tasks is cleaning or replacing the air filters every 1-3
months, as clogged filters restrict airflow and reduce cooling
performance. Checking the thermostat regularly ensures it functions
correctly and maintains an optimal temperature. The evaporator and
condenser coils should be cleaned annually to prevent dirt buildup,
which can impact efficiency. It’s also crucial to keep the outdoor
unit free from debris like leaves and dust to allow proper airflow.
Low refrigerant levels may indicate a leak, so if cooling performance
drops, a professional should inspect and refill it if necessary.
Electrical components should be checked periodically, as loose or
damaged wires can lead to system failure. Additionally, lubricating
moving parts such as motors and fans helps reduce wear and tear.
Regular AC maintenance not only prevents costly repairs but also
ensures your system operates efficiently all year round.+++
